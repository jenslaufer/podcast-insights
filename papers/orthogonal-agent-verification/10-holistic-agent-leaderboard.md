**Problem.** Agent leaderboards report one top-line accuracy number, self-reported, ignoring cost and the *way* agents actually behave to get the score.

**Method.** A standardised, **cost-aware, third-party** evaluation across three axes simultaneously: **models × scaffolds × benchmarks** (coding, web, science, customer service). Scale: **21,730 rollouts**, 9 models × 9 benchmarks, ~**$40k**, weeks→hours via parallel VMs. Released **2.5B tokens of call logs** for LLM-aided behavioural inspection.

**Findings worth remembering.**
- More **reasoning effort often *reduced* accuracy** — "think harder" is not monotonic.
- Agents did bizarre things: searching HuggingFace instead of solving the task; misusing credit cards in booking flows.
- A score alone hides this — you have to read the *behaviour*.

**Takeaway.** Report **cost and behaviour, not just a top-line score**, and evaluate scaffolds as part of the system. Third-party, log-transparent evaluation catches what self-reported accuracy hides.

**Our stack.** Justifies our cost-tracking on bake-offs and the habit of reading *what the agent did* (file diffs, tool calls), not just whether tests passed.
