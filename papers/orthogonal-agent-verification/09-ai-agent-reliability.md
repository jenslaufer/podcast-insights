**Problem.** A single success metric "obscures critical operational flaws." Two agents with the same accuracy can be wildly different to operate — one steady, one erratic.

**Method.** Decompose agent reliability into **four dimensions**, each with concrete metrics (12 in total):
- **Consistency** — same behaviour across repeated runs.
- **Robustness** — survives perturbation of the input/environment.
- **Predictability** — failures fall into expected, anticipatable patterns.
- **Safety** — errors stay bounded; no catastrophic blow-ups.

**Key finding.** Testing 15 models on 2 benchmarks: recent **capability gains brought only small reliability gains**. Accuracy and reliability are *different axes* — getting smarter does not automatically get more trustworthy.

**Takeaway.** Measure reliability separately from capability. "Is it good?" and "can I depend on it?" are distinct questions and need distinct metrics.

**Our stack.** Argues for tracking run-to-run consistency of our agents/Fabrik workers — not just whether a PR passed once. This is the meta-layer over all the verification methods: it measures whether the agent *behaves* reliably at all.
